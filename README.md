# simpler-peer
how simple is simple-peer ?

## answer: pretty simple.
you just gotta do the signaling yourself.

## demo

open `index.html#1`, copy the outgoing offer and paste in the text area of `index.html`, click submit, now they are connected.

in the real world, instead of copying and pasting, you can use a websocket, some database (like firestore), or even carrier pigeon ðŸ˜‰

## version

note, this uses a copy of `simplepeer.min.js` at version `9.6.2`
